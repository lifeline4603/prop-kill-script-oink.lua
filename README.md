> [!WARNING]
> this github repository is no longer being updated so any updates or push requests will get ignored.

notes:
- this only works if you have access to the **oink api (oink.industries).** the functionality of this script relies completely on it
- theres a faq in the loader
- instructions are provided when you load the script
- the base script is obfuscated
- if this gets updated, you'll automatically have the update as long as you use the loader.
